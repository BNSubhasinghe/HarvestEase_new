            Samba is a fragrant paddy type with fine grains that require a longer growth period compared to other varieties. 
            This paddy is well-known for its aroma, soft texture, and premium quality rice. Due to its longer cultivation time, 
            Samba is best suited for regions with consistent rainfall or access to irrigation.
            <br /><br />
            The cooked rice is soft, aromatic, and sticky, making it a favorite for festive occasions and traditional dishes in Sri Lanka.
            It is primarily grown during the Maha season for optimal yield and quality.
