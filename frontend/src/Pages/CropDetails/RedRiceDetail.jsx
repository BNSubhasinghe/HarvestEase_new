            Red Rice is a traditional paddy variety known for its nutritional value and distinctive red bran layer. 
            It is rich in fiber, antioxidants, and essential nutrients, making it ideal for health-conscious consumers. 
            This variety requires less water and grows well in both wet and dry regions.
            <br /><br />
            The cooked rice has a nutty flavor and chewy texture, often used in traditional Sri Lankan meals. 
            Farmers favor Red Rice for its resilience, sustainability, and growing market demand for organic food.
