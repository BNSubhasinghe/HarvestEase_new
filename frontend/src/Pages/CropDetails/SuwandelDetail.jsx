            Suwandel is a premium aromatic paddy variety, traditionally grown with organic methods. 
            It is prized for its rich aroma, soft texture, and nutritional benefits. 
            The grains are long, slender, and slightly sticky when cooked.
            <br /><br />
            Suwandel requires fertile soil and careful cultivation, making it a choice for small-scale specialty farming. 
            Its rice is highly sought after for festive meals and export markets due to its unique taste and fragrance.
