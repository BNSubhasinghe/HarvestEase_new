            Bg 352 is a high-yield hybrid paddy variety developed for short-term cultivation. It matures quickly, 
            making it ideal for areas with limited growing seasons or farmers seeking faster harvest cycles. 
            This variety is resistant to common pests and diseases.
            <br /><br />
            The grains are slender and white, with good cooking quality and texture. Due to its efficiency and productivity, 
            Bg 352 is widely adopted by commercial farmers across Sri Lanka.
