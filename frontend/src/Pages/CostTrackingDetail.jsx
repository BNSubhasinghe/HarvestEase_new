          The Cost & Financial Management function streamlines the entire process of selling and transporting harvested crops. It enables farmers to set the prices for their produce, manage sales records, and connect directly with potential buyers. Through this system, farmers can easily list available crops for sale, and buyers can browse and place orders, ensuring smoother transactions. It also allows farmers to track each order, from confirmation to delivery, helping ensure timely and efficient distribution. Additionally, the system includes a financial management component that records expenses and calculates profits automatically by comparing total income with total costs. Farmers can generate detailed sales reports and view profit breakdowns based on crop type or specific time periods. The system also provides valuable financial insights, suggesting cost-saving opportunities and highlighting areas with high expenses. Overall, this function empowers farmers to optimize their revenue, make data-driven decisions, and improve the overall efficiency of their distribution process.
